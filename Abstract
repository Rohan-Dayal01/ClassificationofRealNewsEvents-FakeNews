Fake news on social media is a major threat to modern institutions. Dissemination of fake news stories causes social unrest, and prevents people from correctly understanding something before making a decision. This study sought to differentiate Tweets about real news stories from Tweets about fake news stories on Twitter. The stories chosen were related to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election due to the high levels of fake news on social media at the time. Data was mined directly from the Twitter API using the Python library Searchtweets, and features about each Tweet were collected: Text, Date, Created_seconds, User_id, Retweet_count, Favorite_count,  Hashtags, Follower_count, Following_count. Tweet data was stored into csv. files, and labelled as real or fake. Data for Retweet_count, Favorite_count, Follower_count, Following_count, and hashtag count were used to train a support vector machine algorithm (the other features only made sure Tweets were on topic). The support vector machine took 70% of the data for training, and 30% for testing. 10 fold cross-validation was implemented so that different data points were partitioned for each trial. Results of the classifier showed low variation in accuracy scores, and constant precision scores. However, when the features of Follower_count and Following_count were removed from the algorithm, the precision scores of the algorithm were extremely scattered. This indicates that Follower_count and Following_count may be significant predictors of whether a Tweet is about a real news story, or a fake news story. Future research should be conducted on the correlation between these two features, and Tweet veracity, without which the data that Twitter provides is not enough to draw conclusions as to whether Tweets are about real or fake news.
